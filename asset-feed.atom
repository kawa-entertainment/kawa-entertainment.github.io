        <content type="html"><![CDATA[VTube Studio is the defacto app for Live2D vtubers. The app uses your smartphone or webcam to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/). The model is shown directly on your phone or your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.

Steering Wheel and Hat inspired by Mario Kart! This is a Live2d rigged vtuber asset for vtube studio. Not a png or animated gif.

Make sure to adjust the x and y angles. So the angles of the hat fit your model!

Also, make sure to adjust the "x and y shift". So that the hat is centered on your head when you turn so it doesn't fall off your vtuber models head

Change letter on hat: Left shift + Letter

Turn off lights on steering wheel: Left shift + 1

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[VTubing is fun and awesome and cool! But for people looking to get into it, there can be steep prices. If you're not up for using a pre-made model, vTubers just starting out will most likely look into commissioning a custom model and rig, running anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. But! What if someone wants to dip their toes in the VTubing scene without spending money, while also showing off their own personalized design? Well, that's where VTuber Kit comes in.

vTuber kit is an all-in-one solution. It comes with OpenSeeFace integrated, meaning you will be able to open the program and instantly have camera facial tracking as well as microphone input good to go.

And of course, VTuber Kit's main draw point is model customization. VTuber Kit is stuffed full of various parts to mix and match to create your own personal flair, with much more planned to be added soon. Users can customize colors, mix-and-match clothes, pick out various hair parts, and slap on accessories to create something they like.

Users can then stream with the character they've made! Since this is being built on top of my own personal vTubing solution, they will also get some benefits like Twitch integrations for redeeming headpats using the Twitch Channel points system if they choose to do so. Users will be free to take what they've made and use that design when crafting their own personal model/rig in the future if they so wish.]]></content>

https://twitter.com/k1ruse/status/1550556818715586561?s=20&t=4oleqjl6tCLj8Z6jbzsjHA

##### You CAN change the colors in VTS:

When you load a new item in, press "configure/finetune", and on the next page after hitting "save", you can edit colors to match your own model using the "multiply/screen" feature!

##### File includes:

- Cat Ear VTS item files (.moc3, .cdi3, .model3, .phsyics3, texture file, .vtube)
- Terms and Conditions.txt (+ how to change the colors in VTS)

##### Before purchasing:

- I highly suggest testing VTube Studio's existing Live2D animal ear items to see if this will attach well to your model. Pinning items can be tricky to get right.
- This asset acts as a "Live2D sticker" above or behind your model, this will not work as well above horns or similar head accessories!

##### Terms & Conditions:

- Do not redistribute or resell the file or its contents.
- Do not rip the art and use it in any way not pertaining to this asset.
- You may edit and customize the colors of the item in VTube Studio, as well as on the texture file. Please keep texture file edits to simple color changes/adding accessories (piercings, etc).
- If you are using this asset often, please credit me on the about page of your streaming platform of choice. Along with a link to the product page!

---

_With your purchase of my files, please respect the terms that come with it. Your integrity is extremely appreciated._
