        <content type="html"><![CDATA[**Are you looking to do workout / horror streams? Why not connect your heartbeat to VTube Studio?**

#### Info

* Support for many heart rate monitors with pulsoid.net and ANT+!
* Configurable model tinting that scales with pulse!
* Automatic expression and hotkey triggering at desired heart rate thresholds!
* Custom tracking parameters for pulse and breath!

#### About

This plugin is developed by Tom "Skeletom" Farro. If you need to contact him, the best way to do so is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/FomTarro).

If you're more of an email-oriented person, you can contact his support email: [tom@skeletom.net](mailto:tom@skeletom.net).

#### Usage

Getting up and running is relatively straightforward. The plugin will automatically connect to VTube Studio on launch. From there, do the following steps:

* Input an estimated minimum and maximum heartrate.
* Select a desired heartrate input method. You can connect over Bluetooth using your phone and [pulsoid.net](https://www.pulsoid.net/), or connect directly to your PC with an [ANT+](https://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/what-is-ant) USB dongle.
* Add Art Mesh Tint modules and configure them to parts of your model!
* Add Expression and Hotkey Trigger modules and configure them to activate model functions automatically!
* Hook up Custom Tracking Parameters your model for things like breathing speed!

For the complete guide on all input and output features, [the unabridged readme can be found here](https://github.com/FomTarro/vts-heartrate#readme) (also accessible from within the plugin under **Settings** -> **Open README**).

#### Custom Parameters

This plugin outputs four custom tracking parameters for use. They are as follows:

* `VTS_Heartrate_Linear`: A value that scales from 0.0 to 1.0 as your heartrate moves across the expected range.
* `VTS_Heartrate_Pulse`: A value that oscillates between 0.0 and 1.0 with a frequency exactly matching your heartrate.
* `VTS_Heartrate_Breath`: A value that oscillates between 0.0 and 1.0 with a frequency slower than Pulse, suitable for controlling your model's ParamBreath output.
* `VTS_Heartrate_BPM`: A value that represents the actual current heartrate in BPM.

#### Install instructions

This is a plugin for VTube Studio, so naturally it requires an installation of VTube Studio, which is available for free on Steam.

Simply unzip the folder and run the bundled .exe file to launch the plugin, no installation required.

The plugin will request network permission so as to be able to connect with VTube Studio, and optionally connect with pulsoid.net.]]></content>

##### You CAN change the colors in VTS:

When you load a new item in, press "configure/finetune", and on the next page after hitting "save", you can edit colors to match your own model using the "multiply/screen" feature!

##### File includes:

- Cat Ear VTS item files (.moc3, .cdi3, .model3, .phsyics3, texture file, .vtube)
- Terms and Conditions.txt (+ how to change the colors in VTS)

##### Before purchasing:

- I highly suggest testing VTube Studio's existing Live2D animal ear items to see if this will attach well to your model. Pinning items can be tricky to get right.
- This asset acts as a "Live2D sticker" above or behind your model, this will not work as well above horns or similar head accessories!

##### Terms & Conditions:

- Do not redistribute or resell the file or its contents.
- Do not rip the art and use it in any way not pertaining to this asset.
- You may edit and customize the colors of the item in VTube Studio, as well as on the texture file. Please keep texture file edits to simple color changes/adding accessories (piercings, etc).
- If you are using this asset often, please credit me on the about page of your streaming platform of choice. Along with a link to the product page!

---

_With your purchase of my files, please respect the terms that come with it. Your integrity is extremely appreciated._

Steering Wheel and Hat inspired by Mario Kart! This is a Live2d rigged vtuber asset for vtube studio. Not a png or animated gif.

Make sure to adjust the x and y angles. So the angles of the hat fit your model!

Also, make sure to adjust the "x and y shift". So that the hat is centered on your head when you turn so it doesn't fall off your vtuber models head

Change letter on hat: Left shift + Letter

Turn off lights on steering wheel: Left shift + 1

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[VTubing is fun and awesome and cool! But for people looking to get into it, there can be steep prices. If you're not up for using a pre-made model, vTubers just starting out will most likely look into commissioning a custom model and rig, running anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. But! What if someone wants to dip their toes in the VTubing scene without spending money, while also showing off their own personalized design? Well, that's where VTuber Kit comes in.

vTuber kit is an all-in-one solution. It comes with OpenSeeFace integrated, meaning you will be able to open the program and instantly have camera facial tracking as well as microphone input good to go.

And of course, VTuber Kit's main draw point is model customization. VTuber Kit is stuffed full of various parts to mix and match to create your own personal flair, with much more planned to be added soon. Users can customize colors, mix-and-match clothes, pick out various hair parts, and slap on accessories to create something they like.

Users can then stream with the character they've made! Since this is being built on top of my own personal vTubing solution, they will also get some benefits like Twitch integrations for redeeming headpats using the Twitch Channel points system if they choose to do so. Users will be free to take what they've made and use that design when crafting their own personal model/rig in the future if they so wish.]]></content>
