We also showcase the latest in VTuber tech the community needs to know.\r\n\r\nWhile others focus on talents from major agencies, we want to when possible show the spotlight on other VTuber groups and what impact they have in their communities.\r\n\r\n#### Weekly Recap\r\n\r\nA weekly list of relevant links and stories (the Weekly Recap) brings together updates from all sides of the community - the latest stories on talents, music, merchandise, events, research, and more.\r\n\r\n#### Our Standards\r\n\r\n1. Do nothing our staff cannot defend.\r\n2. Cover, write and present every story with the care our staff would want if the story were about them.\r\n3. Assume there is at least one other side or version to every story.\r\n4. Assume the viewer is as smart and caring and good as our staff.\r\n5. Assume the same about all people on whom our staff reports.\r\n6. Assume personal lives are a private matter until a legitimate turn in the story absolutely mandates otherwise.\r\n7. Carefully separate opinion and analysis from straight news stories and clearly label everything.\r\n8. Do not use anonymous sources or blind quotes except on rare and monumental occasions. No one should be allowed to attack another anonymously.\r\n\r\n#### Meet Our Writers\r\n\r\n* [@vg_pidge](https://twitter.com/vg_pidge)\r\n* [@JayAgonoy](https://twitter.com/JayAgonoy)\r\n* [@MontySeelana](https://twitter.com/MontySeelana)",

            "content_html": "### Virtual entertainers, big and small\r\n\r\nVTubers‚Äîstreamers that use virtual avatars‚Äîare a phenomenon that is rapidly gaining traction worldwide. Originally starting in Japan five years ago with the rise of Kizuna Ai, VTubers are now a burgeoning industry with a strong grip on mainstays like YouTube and Twitch.\r\n\r\nBut what of the smaller VTubers? Personalities who took inspiration from industry giants like Kiryu Coco, Ironmouse, and Gawr Gura? The indie VTuber scene is complex in depth, it‚Äôs warm and welcoming, and it‚Äôs accepting newcomers every day.\r\n\r\nThere are many people that have joined the indie VTuber scene for confidence, community, and a creative outlet. Join me in talking to three such indies about the journeys they had, and the lessons they learned.\r\n\r\n### Peering Behind the Mask\r\n\r\n![Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pok√©mon.](/src/assets/content/images/mavia-pokemon.png \"Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pok√©mon.\")\r\n\r\n_Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pok√©mon._\r\n\r\nI reached out to [Lucastre Mavia](https://www.youtube.com/c/maviaa), a harpy VTuber, wanting to understand the journey she‚Äôs taken as a VTuber‚Äîand she said that she‚Äôd wanted to stream and make content for quite some time.\r\n\r\n> _I really wanted a space to create my own safe little fantasy world full of the things I love that I could share with others, just like the spaces that I found solace in. And even if it was just going to be shared with one or two people, I knew it‚Äôd still be worth it, so I just dove in without thinking too much._\r\n\r\nThis begs the question‚Äîwhy VTubing specifically? I asked Mavia what made her decide to take the leap with VTubing, and not any previous creative outlet. To her, personal freedom and escapism was a big deal.\r\n\r\n> _I think escapism played a big part of what drew me to \\[VTubing\\], but I ended up staying for how kind the experience felt. Even if it‚Äôs just for a few hours a day, being able to immerse yourself in a world of someone‚Äôs own creation is pretty cool, I think. The rest of the world kind of fades away._\r\n\r\nIn the real world, she‚Äôs a student going through the same quarantine struggles that we all face. But as Mavia, she‚Äôs a harpy transfer student from the fantasy realm of Alknoste, and she‚Äôs here to play Pok√©mon and foster a warm community. Mavia‚Äôs story is echoed by thousands upon thousands of independent VTubers‚Äîpeople looking for freedom of expression and a strong sense of community.\r\n\r\n### Freedom in Form and Function\r\n\r\nThere‚Äôs a subtle logic to the feeling of freedom that VTubers get when they take on their anime personalities. You would imagine them preparing to play an embellished character like an actor about to go on stage ‚Äì but, no, nearly every VTuber simply plays themselves. The sneaky part is‚Äîthey‚Äôre somehow more themselves.\r\n\r\nAsk an indie VTuber why they joined the trade and they‚Äôre very likely to tell you the same thing‚Äîthey wanted a character to hide behind instead of using a webcam or a disembodied voice.\r\n\r\nMany people dream of being entertainers or even just moderately successful Twitch streamers‚Äîbut are held back by fear. Thus does the subtle beauty of VTubing come to light‚ÄîIt‚Äôs a mask to put on, a barrier to erect that would take the brunt of the nasty reactions that we all know the internet is capable of. That air gap empowers people to be themselves without holding back.\r\n\r\n[Akumako Rei](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKj-DqyMpHgYNB3-9lZq8-w) is another such indie, drawn to VTubing as an alternative to face cam.\r\n\r\n> _I think removing the physical aspect makes people more confident in themselves‚Äîlike if they thought they didn‚Äôt look pretty, but would be otherwise confident in their voice or personality, it would remove their worries._\r\n\r\n![Akumako Rei, delinquent VTuber. Ara-ara aficionado. Genshin Impact whale.](/src/assets/content/images/rei-hollow-knight.jpg \"Akumako Rei, delinquent VTuber. Ara-ara aficionado. Genshin Impact whale.\")\r\n\r\n_Akumako Rei, delinquent VTuber. Ara-ara aficionado. Genshin Impact whale._\r\n\r\nFace cams have the possibility of introducing bias based on things the streamer can‚Äôt control‚Äîtheir physical appearance. As Rei puts it: _‚Äú‚Ä¶With face cam, there are privileges that are awarded just based on how people look‚Äîand VTubing evens the playing field.‚Äù_\r\n\r\nIn fact, for most of her VTubing career, Rei wasn‚Äôt even a living, breathing, anime girl. She was a static image in the corner of the screen‚Äîknown as a PNGtuber‚Äîbecause she didn‚Äôt yet have the opportunity to get her model animated. She found that to be supremely validating, coming to the realization that, if people were still watching her, then it could only mean that _‚Äú‚Ä¶people like me for me, because all they‚Äôre looking at is a still image.‚Äù_\r\n\r\n### Celebrating Their True Selves\r\n\r\nWhen a nervous and socially anxious person wears their anime mask, they can put on an air of self-confidence they wouldn‚Äôt normally have in everyday life. When a camera-shy entertainer wants to show off their gaming skills, or their artistic talents, or their melodious singing, they aren‚Äôt embarrassing themselves‚Äîthey‚Äôre embarrassing a persona. When someone struggling with gender or body dysphoria turns on their face-rigging technology, they can feel at ease with the body looking back at them.\r\n\r\nTo these people, VTubing isn‚Äôt just a gimmick. It‚Äôs a way to share their true selves online, on a platform uniquely suited to letting them shine. It‚Äôs what drew [Fuwako Yuni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYwIwzpWS-LyCQa8W-eJuw) into VTubing.\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/yuni-dbd-2.png)\r\n\r\n_Fuwako Yuni, alicorn VTuber. Sweet and friendly, except when she‚Äôs playing Dead by Daylight._\r\n\r\nOn being asked why she became a VTuber, Yuni prioritized _‚Äú‚Ä¶the freedom and creative form of expression that you can‚Äôt get with in-real-life content creation. While it has its own limitations in comparison, as a VTuber you create who you want to be.‚Äù_\r\n\r\n> I definitely feel like I‚Äôm more myself when I‚Äôm using my model‚Ä¶ There are so many things that you can‚Äôt or just don‚Äôt have the means to control, that you can change with your model. Body type, hair style, color, height, gender, you don‚Äôt even need to be human if you don‚Äôt want to. I think it‚Äôs a lot of fun to see how people choose to express themselves with the amount of freedom that comes with their model.\r\n\r\n<album>\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/mavia-cookies.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/rei-darksouls.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/yuni-drawing.jpg)\r\n\r\n</album>\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly, VTubers see the technology as a boost to confidence. If anyone can look like anything, then your looks don‚Äôt actually matter. But don‚Äôt take my word for it‚ÄîMavia explains it well:\r\n\r\n> I think that with only your words and actions to judge you by, and a lack of obligation to people who make you uncomfortable, it‚Äôs a lot easier to create a curated personal experience and community online. And when you find like-minded or open-minded people, you feel more comfortable speaking your mind.\r\n\r\n### The VTuber Family\r\n\r\nCommunity is tantamount to the indie scene, something that is readily apparent to viewers‚ÄîVTubers all seem to know each other. Collaborations are a frequent sight, and everyone is friendly enough that a small VTuber will often be able to stream alongside someone they idolized just weeks ago. Mavia‚Äôs advice? Make friends.\r\n\r\n> I think when you‚Äôre a smaller streamer, there‚Äôs this fear that you shouldn‚Äôt reach out to larger ones because they might think you‚Äôre just looking for an easy plug. My experiences with creators, however small or large, have been extremely positive. I really encourage new VTubers to not be shy and reach out to make new friends.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs no surprise‚Äîin a community where everyone has similar interests in anime and gaming, it‚Äôs not hard to find friends. Beyond that, everyone is incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nVTubing is new‚Äîthe concept is only a few years old, and the technology is evolving every day. To a fresh-faced VTuber, that means everyone they look up to was in their shoes very recently.\r\n\r\nEveryone understands the growing pains, the small-streamer struggles of finding friends, troubleshooting technical issues, and growing a fanbase. As such, a new VTuber will find no shortage of people that aren‚Äôt merely understanding but will go out of their way to help.\r\n\r\n### The Gate‚Äôs Open\r\n\r\nTo any prospective VTubers, Mavia suggests taking it slow, and enjoying the process and the community.\r\n\r\n> Stream to your friends. Just because you enjoy watching someone stream something or you enjoy doing something doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll enjoy streaming it. Figure out one or two things you want to focus on and focus your energy into doing those things and doing them well.\r\n\r\n> Take it slow. Don‚Äôt expect instant growth, especially if you‚Äôre not coming from a content creation background. Connect with people and form friendships and good relationships. Of course, it‚Äôs still important to be critical of yourself. What kinds of content creators do you enjoy watching, and why? How can you put your own spin on that? Give it a try. If you don‚Äôt like it, try something else. There‚Äôs no rush.\r\n\r\nShe also suggests making use of resource marketplaces. _‚ÄúBooth, Nizima, Twitter and DLsite are your best friends for finding assets and models. There are tons of free assets, too! Make sure to credit your artists.‚Äù_\r\n\r\nRei suggests that you pander only to your biggest fan‚Äîyourself.\r\n\r\n> Honestly, my advice is‚Äîyou do you. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to do things to make you big. Yeah, you can go get a hot model and sound cute, but the people that like that content won‚Äôt stay for long. Be true to yourself, as true as you want to be. You can still play a character, but if you don‚Äôt like certain kinds of content, don‚Äôt make it.\r\n\r\nRei also suggests you prepare for a long journey. _‚ÄúStars aren‚Äôt born, they‚Äôre made like swords. Hit them over and over again until they‚Äôre sharp enough to strike.‚Äù_\r\n\r\nYuni stresses the importance of taking things slowly but surely, honing your experience and skill along the way\r\n\r\n> My best advice for people is to start streaming‚Äîhaving a fancy model means nothing if you do nothing with it. Getting experience and learning to overcome the hurdles of being a new streamer will help you much more than waiting until you have the best model you can. If you plan on investing into streaming, try to do it smartly with things that remain useful even if you don‚Äôt keep streaming, such as microphones or monitors.\r\n\r\n<album>\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/rei-genshin.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/mavia-10k.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/src/assets/content/images/yuni-pokemon-legends.jpg)\r\n\r\n</album>\r\n\r\n### You‚Äôre Invited\r\n\r\nThe VTuber world is expansive, it‚Äôs freeing, and it‚Äôs welcoming. However, it‚Äôs certainly no utopia‚Äîit‚Äôs an industry that expects heavy monetary investment in your computer, your streaming equipment, and your VTuber model itself. However, if you just want to dip your toes into the community and get a feel for how you‚Äôd like it‚Äîif you‚Äôve ever thought you wanted to stream or create but held yourself back‚Äîthen there are free ways to see if VTubing is right for you.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, any aspiring VTuber should find solace and friendship with other aspiring VTubers, in the [ENVTubers Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/envtubers). This community has been cultivated to be the perfect launchpad for new VTubers, giving them the answers, resources, and camaraderie they need.\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôll also need a VTuber model itself, to which I recommend [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) to create a 3D model, and [VSeeFace]() to capture your face. Both services are free, and [Argama Witch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwpITXXDve9uqRDwKp7yXKhQCqCAsnH3j) has great tutorials on making the most use of VRoid Studio to help you create the model that perfectly represents you.\r\n\r\nVTubing is a big industry and it‚Äôs getting bigger. Many of the big names have never streamed before being a VTuber. The gate is wide open, whether you want to express yourself, shoot for fame and fortune, or simply want to be the anime person of your dreams.\r\n\r\n**_A kind thank you to our interviewees Fuwako Yuni, Akumako Rei, and Lucastre Mavia for taking the time to answer our questions._**",
