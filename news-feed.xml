            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, we reported that AniManGaki 2022, one of the biggest annual anime/cosplay/gaming events in Malaysia, will showcase 80 VTubers. In addition, the event also has VTubers performing on stage as part of the program. Here are some snippets from this year's event.

## VTuber Showcase Area

With help from Twitch IRL streamer [AGCtv](https://www.twitch.tv/agctv), we are able to take a peek inside the dedicated area where standees of 80 Malaysia VTubers are placed at a distance from each other.

Some TV screens show clips from featured VTubers, while there's one screen that's used by select VTubers to interact with the audience inside. There's also an opportunity to buy merchandise, as well as give presents to the talents. Visitors can also take-home postcards.

Production Kawaii released a teaser video of the talents on August 22. The talents officially debuted on August 28.

`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3mdMcI1HeY`

## Peony Aeria

> _Long ago, the human world and the fairy world were connected. The curious Peony Aeria took it upon herself to secretly learn more about their world and see if she could reunite the two realms.   
>   
> Too bad that she eventually got caught by Kinoshita and was banished from her home. With the goal to make humans happy and connect them to nature, she has now become a VTuber in his company!_

## Oceane Otoishi

> _As a siren, Oceane was expected to follow in the footsteps of her sisters. But after meeting a mermaid friend, Oceane knew she wanted to be one. She sought the help of an alchemist and asked to be transformed into a mermaid.   
>   
> But first, she has to prove her loyalty by becoming a kind human. With the scroll tucked in her necklace, she gained legs and eventually became a VTuber._

## Miryu Kotofuji

> _Miryu is a young air dragon with a passion for music. Upon hearing about the wonders of human music from a tiny magical friend, she became curious about what life would be like on Earth.   
>   
> But with 845 years of dragon school to go, it seems that the only way for Miryu to experience the outside world is to become... a VTuber!_

## Aletta Sky

> _A bright Pegasus girl who lives among the stars! She has always wanted to connect with the people of Earth through VTubing so she created a door to get there. But she got into trouble pretty quickly after not following the procedure when taking a cute white fluffy dog from the shelter.   
>   
> Luckily Kinoshita-san found her, not only did he help her out but is also helping her VTubing dreams come true._

## Sava Safari

> _A jungle princess from the mysterious beast clan! Always positive to a fault, she embarks on a quest to befriend the mythical human world- the Chief hoping the impossible task will grant her some maturity. Instead, Sava finds herself trading her leafy jungle for a concrete one! _
>
> _Equipped with her wild spirit, she hopes to inject some chaotic color into the human world!_

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Roza Coatl, formerly a VTuber talent from the now disbanded agency Haven-X, is [officially joining](https://www.4vlive.com/post/welcome-to-4v-live-roza-coatl) the VTuber talent roster of 4V Live, a US-based agency. Coatl previously announced her departure from Haven-X on July 11 due to health concerns.

https://twitter.com/4VLiveOfficial/status/1563964947234562048

By joining 4V Live, Coatl will officially be part of the agency’s new talent class called ‘4V Farfarers’, with her being the first member. The agency had previously teased her transition with [a single tweet](https://twitter.com/4VLiveOfficial/status/1562931586164834304) with glitched text, an allude to Coatl’s style of tweets.

Following the announcement, Coatl will be having her 4V Live debut on September 2 at 6PM EDT. In the upcoming stream, she stated that she will be addressing her reasons regarding the agency transition. This follows almost two weeks after [Haven-X disbanded](https://kawaentertainment.com/news/haven-x-disbands-following-graduation-of-its-talents/) with the graduation of its talents Koa Himari and Viri Sylvaine.

The 4V Live VTuber roster is composed of first-generation members Vivian Voss, Orion Juno, and Angelina Kumalo; and their second-generation members Boomi Mamana, Neiomi Cielo, and Yuna Sunaga. [Cecilia Amberfall](https://www.4vlive.com/post/official-statement-regarding-cecilia-amberfall), one of its second-generation talents, moved on as an independent VTuber on March 11.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[US-based VTuber agency Tsunderia has announced new updates regarding its upcoming VTuber generation, as well as clarifying its recent announcement of an upcoming event in September.

https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1563330466496876546

In one of its recent tweets, Tsunderia captioned its tweet with “_...we’ll all still carry the fond memories of our time together._” This announcement has been perceived differently by the community, with some speculating that the announcement could be a mass graduation of talents.

To clear up the air, Tsunderia has noted in a [follow-up tweet](https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1563662647878455296?s=20&t=-S7y_cw3sR9T-eO2baSXhg) that the announcement was for an “upcoming project,” although they never mentioned any hint of the project’s nature. The agency also added that they hope fans will look forward to it.

Furthermore, Tsunderia also [announced](https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1563692845780926465) that they have recently concluded reviewing numerous VTuber applications for its upcoming generation. It has then reminded applicants to check their email a week after if they will pass to the next stage of the auditions. Tsunderia opened up auditions for its fourth generation on June 29 this year.

Tsunderia has been the subject of scrutiny within the VTubing community following its ‘mass graduation’ on April 23. Its former talents, Nini Yuuna, Miori Celesta, Orla Gan Ceann, and Matsuro Meru all went on to become independent VTubers.

As of this writing Tsunderia has its third generation composed of Tsurugi Nen, Uzuki Tomoya, Chikafuji Lisa, Tetsuya Kazune, and Amiya Aranha; as well as Generation 0’s Inukai Purin and Generation 2’s Amemachi Hanabi.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[UMISEA, one of the VTuber sub-units under Hololive, has released a new single titled “_It Comes Ryuuu And It Goes Kyuuu_”. The track–almost two minutes long–is also accompanied with a music video.

UMISEA is now composed of Hololive Japan talents Houshou Marine, Minato Aqua and Sakamata Chloe; as well as Hololive English talents Gawr Gura and Ninomae Ina'nis. The track was teased during a short anime video titled [_Going Missing_](https://youtu.be/Wrpz5U6eO78), featuring all of the aforementioned talents being at sea.

`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOFOmeHAmfk`

The sub-unit was first formed on September 14, 2021, along with the single release “_Domination! All the World Is an Ocean_”. The unit was formed due to the ocean-like similarities between the lore of each talent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hololive ERROR, an upcoming horror title published by COVER Corp. and developed by Mogura. The game which features Hololive talents such as Tokino Sora and Shirakami Fubuki now has a [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062550/hololive_ERROR/), where enthusiasts can add to their wishlists and follow before its Fall 2022 release date.

First announced in July 2021 with a [teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHekCdRagR8), and a [360° video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjkfM2by6rc) that following August showcasing some beloved VTubers, Hololive ERROR will be a first-person action-adventure horror title following a journalist for an occult magazine investigating paranormal occurrences in the town of Aogami:

> “The stage is set in Aogami-cho, which is known in the neighborhood as the so-called "town with a story" because of its many eerie legends and incidents.The main character, who is a reporter for an occult magazine, will follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, who was a reporter, and report on the strange things that occur in this town.
>
> He should be spending his time gathering information and writing articles in a hotel room, but when he realizes what the reasoning is, he ends up in a mysterious school.”

According to [Siliconera](https://www.siliconera.com/hololive-error-appears-in-steam-store/), Hololive ERROR boasts multiple endings that unlock depending on how the player progresses through the game. There is a free version of the game available on the [Hololive Error website](https://hololiveerror.hololivepro.com/), though it is only in Japanese.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sega of Japan [announced](https://twitter.com/SonicOfficialJP/status/1562290612858388480) an exciting collaboration with Hololive’s very own Inugami Korone to provide incredible bonuses for fans of both the super-fast hedgehog and gamer dog for Sonic Frontiers, which is due to release on November 8th.

According to [Nintendo Life](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/sonic-frontiers-pre-orders-come-with-famous-v-tuber-dlc-in-japan), these bonuses, which are apparently exclusive to Japan, will provide different Sonic- and Korone-themed items depending on where a customer pre-orders the upcoming game.

The shops offering their own unique Korone-themed bonuses are Amazon, which offers Korone sound effects, GEO which offers a Sonic-themed Korone original acrylic panel, Joshin Deki which has Korone-themed shoes and gloves that Sonic can wear, and Rakuten Books will replace the mascot character "Coco" to "Koronesuki"

There is no word on whether any of these bonuses will reach the West, but it is not likely unless a customer imports the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Part of NewsDrop’s activities is to feature various VTuber-related events across the globe, starting of course, in Japan, where the trend blew up. Slime alien VTuber and Kawa colleague PiaPi UFO shares her experience at the recent [Nijisanji EN Animate Cafe](https://cafe.animate.co.jp/event/nijisanji-en2208/) collaboration.

This cafe collab features Nijisanji EN livers Pomu Rainpuff (LazuLight), Selen Tatsuki (Obsydia), Reimu Endou (Ethyria), Ike Eveland, Shu Yamino and Luca Kaneshiro (Luxiem).

Pia was there to help a friend, Pomu obsessed cosplayer [@RoReRuRu](https://twitter.com/roreruru), get lucky in scoring some randomized Pomu merch.

The Animate Collab Cafe serves drinks, desserts, and meals based on the VTubers of Nijisanji EN. Though some collabs put on by the Animate Cafe feature a dish each per character, this time around they opted to group the trio of girls and boys into two separate lunch plates and dessert plates. However, each was featured in a drink based on them, so you could grab the taste of your _oshi_ to wash it down!

![](/src/assets/content/images/20220821_125116.jpg)

Inside the cafe were 21 tables, each reserved for a pair. Seats are filled through an online reservation system, so you have to reserve your time slot in advance (There are walk-ins, but only become available if a pair doesn’t show). Doing so will also help you, especially if there are pre-order items only, as they will ask for your shipping address for future delivery.

![](/src/assets/content/images/20220821_123032.jpg)

One of Ruru’s goals was to add more items to her Pomu Rainpuff shrine, but was she able to secure the items? Unfortunately, the group came up dry in their random coaster drawings, pulling 3 Ike coasters, 2 Selen, 2 Reimu, and 1 Luca. No Pomu makes for a sad Ruru!

![](/src/assets/content/images/20220821_122719.jpg)

However, fret not because this particular Animate Cafe is located at Ikebukuro, also known as Otome Road, or the Akihabara for women/_fujoshi_! As such, coaster trades were plentiful with other guests! “_Most people around us had brought the men’s plate and men’s dessert and various male talents’ drinks. They were more than happy to surrender the Pomu goods to us in exchange for a chap or two!_”

Did we forget to mention that the Ninisani gag is made canon here?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[PRISM Project producer Shogun held an [Ask Me Anything (AMA) event](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wu33ns/ama5pm_edt_im_shogun_producer_of_virtual_talent/?sort=top) on the r/VirtualYouTubers subreddit Monday, August 22. This opened the opportunity for PRISM fans to know more about its [ongoing audition](https://kawaentertainment.com/news/prism-project-opens-2022-auditions/) for its 5th generation, as well as his day in the life as a producer for the project.

Shogun revealed his day in a life as a VTuber producer through [his replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wu33ns/comment/il8rdzc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

> "\[...\] I can only speak for myself, but bearing in mind that I'm in Tokyo, I'm usually up by 6:30am, frequently have meetings with overseas clients in the early- to mid-morning, have 2-3 internal PRISM meetings every day, work on the business areas I mentioned above (accounting, legal, sales, marketing/media, admin, etc.) all afternoon, then watch PRISM streams in the evenings, try to clear out my inbox of emails in the late evenings, and hopefully go to bed by 12am-1am.These days I've been lucky to mostly be remote working, but there are days I have face-to-face meetings that require a commute into the city, so there's a few hours of train commute in there sometimes, too!"

Another interesting answer Shogun [provided](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wu33ns/comment/il8p1wt/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is his scope of work as a talent manager, which in turn gives the talents more time to produce more content:

> "\[...\] I'd add to your list things like liaising with external creators (for music or video projects, etc.), general project management assistance, social media management help (something we're looking to strengthen in the next few weeks to months), external sales work (for events like Crunchyroll Expo, but other opportunities we're looking to bring to PRISM as well), providing opportunities for professional networking and skill development, doing any kind of translating/interpreting necessary to work across borders (particularly EN<=>JP) and so on."

Aside from streaming support, securing permissions to stream select games, promotions and marketing, and providing feedback to talents, he [elaborated](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wu33ns/comment/il8rdzc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the set of skills that their managers are expected to have:

> "\[...\] I'll add to the task list in the other comment that our managers really have to be jacks-of-all-trades and be able to handle a little of all the business areas you'd expect: accounting, legal, sales, marketing and media relations, administration, tech support, and so on.The first point of contact for our talents for any question or concern they have is always the management team, and so they really do need a wide range of knowledge and experience to provide the best support possible for each and every talent."

Among the questions asked is a potential entry into other markets:

> "\[...\] Right now, Japanese anime is big all over the world, so there are a lot of really strong markets. I don't have extensive knowledge about the international scene, but there are places like South America or Europe where a lot of anime are localized, and which are really interesting to me. We would like to try out those markets, and if things go well, we may also localize for those markets and foster talents from there."

Several VTubers originated from South America, such as VShojo's [Ironmouse](https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse), [Nimu Spacecat](https://twitter.com/ThisNimu) and Mexican VTuber [PARRA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbk-UQsfmT-etWqU9LOcOg). Europe also enjoys a variety of VTubers such as Live2D artist [Dyarikku](https://www.twitch.tv/dyarikku), Storyteller [Merryweather](https://www.twitch.tv/merryweather), Illustrator [Saruei](https://www.twitch.tv/saruei), and even Hololive English's [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsx4Hqa-1ORjQTh9TYDhww) who hails from Austria.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Aurel Mayori, formerly a member of Indonesian idol group JKT48, has recently teased about her upcoming VTuber model on her YouTube channel. In the YouTube Shorts video, she teased a rigged VTuber model, with a caption translating to “_what anime is this?_”

`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AegmB_wZo`

YoRI, as she is familiarly called, has also posted the video on Twitter, and has invited fans to keep a closer look on her new YouTube channel regarding updates of the VTuber model.

Mayori joined JKT48 in September 2018 as a JKT48 Academy Class B Student. She was then promoted to Class A of the Academy in October 2018. She became part of JKT48’s Team J in October 2019 before being shuffled to Team T in May 2020. She announced her graduation from the group in March 2021.

Following her graduation, she started her independent singing career with the release of her first single “_Unlock._” The song was mixed by Farhan Sarasin, known for his other VTuber music mixes in Hololive Myth’s “_A Journey of a Thousand Years_” for instance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Popular streaming platform Twitch has now announced that streamers signed into the platform as Twitch Partners can now stream to rival streaming platforms available like YouTube and Facebook Gaming. This marks one of Twitch’s biggest moves this year, effectively putting an end to its partner exclusivity clause.

Through its [FAQ page](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/partner-exclusivity-faq?language=en_US), Twitch also encourages its streamers to also promote their Twitch livestreams on other rival platforms as well. However, Twitch clarified that they won’t allow simultaneous streams i.e. hosting your Twitch stream to rival streaming platforms. Once their Twitch stream ends, they can proceed to stream to other streaming platforms their partner is on.

The move is especially relevant for the larger VTubing community, considering the rising number of VTubers hosting their streams on the platform to get a ‘Twitch Partner’ status. In addition, Twitch remains a dominant choice of streaming service for most VTubers this year.

In the latest [Spring 2022 VTuber Census](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE9am3aIE0/diQaP3hJC2W_bknlz98L3A/view?utm_content=DAE9am3aIE0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) conducted by the VTuber Network, over 1,000 VTubers say that Twitch is where they most host their content creation, dwarfing other online platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and even TikTok.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Alchemilla Menace from independent VTuber group Aetheria Project has announced that she will be suspending her streaming activities and go on an indefinite hiatus after her last stream, which will happen on August 26.

In a [personal statement](https://twitter.com/MAlchemilla/status/1562201190166736900) posted by Menace, she said that she is dealing more recently with stress in her real life, and that she needs to take some time off to focus on her family and take care of them.

Aetheria Project has also formally announced Menace’s indefinite hiatus, stating her donation links and Twitch subscriptions will remain open, albeit fans shouldn’t expect any content from Menace’s side.

https://twitter.com/aetheriapro/status/1562204226188877825

Aetheria Project, formerly the US-based VTuber company CyberLive, came into fruition when they debuted their first generation on July 14, 2021. The company rebranded as Aetheria on May 12, citing difficulties in terms of financial / budgetary issues, as well as continued targeted harassment of the company and its talent, according to its [press release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTgKKmhhE53t414X_r7xflnpsT8tIh4jZLFZz7XRG_3HMrV3Sxsi5hkJNmJnh87FfPvpzLHBhMuYJz9/pub) back then.

The current lineup for Aetheria includes Momozora Seina, Utano Pandora, Oumiya Emma, Inami Yoki, and Vera Vee, who formerly served as CyberLive’s manager. Former talents Ayane Hylo and Kurohana Inori became independent VTubers, while Amaris Yuri and Kaneko Lumi transferred to Phase-Connect.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Otaku Expo Tanabata Festival 2022 was recently held on the weekend of August 20-21, and it brought special guest cosplayers Hanari and Toto to the Philippines. Hanari and Toto are members of Hong Kong-based subculture group V-Project whose interest include cosplay, dance and drama performances.

Hololive's Akai Haato (Haachama) has recognized Hanari's[ cosplay](https://twitter.com/TakanashiHanari/status/1454448886949371905) and attention to detail during one of her cosplay contest streams in November 2021 (_Timestamp:_ [_1:01:05_](https://youtu.be/B0a-hm7j-ho?t=3665)), to the point of even following the cosplayer on Twitter.

[Hanari](https://www.instagram.com/takanashi_hanariv3v/) has faithfully cosplayed several VTubers from Hololive as well as Nijisanji's Hyakumantenbara Salome.[ Toto](https://www.instagram.com/toto0w0o/), on the other hand, has also cosplayed as Hololive's Amane Kanata, Momosuzu Nene and Hakui Koyori.

On this feature story, we put the spotlight on Hanari and asked her how she got into the VTuber rabbit hole, and what she felt after being recognized by one. We got her insight into VTuber cosplays as well.

_Adjustments were made in this feature story for clarity._

## How Hanari Ended Up Cosplaying Haachama

Just like any other fan, Hanari started watching VTubers upon recommendation of her friends:

"_I was recommended (VTubers) by my friends, and then I searched the name of the VTubers on YouTube. I saw the clips made by their fans, and then I got fully in-love with Haachama, Sakura Miko, Houshou Marine, and Usada Pekora from Hololive Production._"

Hanari said Haachama's cooking streams are so funny, so much so that she tried cosplaying the VTuber herself. When Haachama opened submissions for the cosplay review stream, Hanari tweeted her cosplay submission. This is how she got recognized: "_She retweeted my photos and followed me back. I'm so glad she showed my pictures on stream._"

How does it feel to be recognized by Haachama? She recalled the time she screamed in excitement and glee as she was mentioned on stream. "_I still remember that memorable moment. I'm so surprised because I've never been posted, tweeted or streamed by a VTuber in their live stream. I'm so proud of myself, and I'm glad I cosplayed her._"

For portraying Akai Haato faithfully, the VTuber told everyone: "_This is so perfect!_" Haachama even used one of her cosplay photos as thumbnails for her streams. "_One of my cosplay photos was made as a thumbnail for her stream, so I really feel proud of myself. I'm so happy, I can't control myself and I just screamed out. I also gave her a superchat after she recognized me._"

## Hanari Lures Friends Into the VTuber Rabbit Hole

Haachama is definitely Hanari's most favorite VTuber character to cosplay, but she also loves cosplaying shrine maiden Mikochi. We asked her how she'd recommend Haachama and Mikochi to others:

"_Maybe I will send them photos of Haachama and Miko on a bed, I guess, lying beside each other. They're actually funny and they are close, showing that they're in the same boat. In conclusion, they are so cute together, so I'm trying to convince my friends to cosplay them. Maybe I can cosplay both characters myself._"

For the record, she cosplayed[ as Miko](https://www.instagram.com/p/CatSnQnBKqe/?hl=en) as a gift for the VTuber's birthday. Also, she told us that she ships Haachama and Mikochi together.

"_Recently, I love the couple of Sakura Miko and Haachama. The_ couple ship _I love the most is Sakura Miko and Haachama. They are so funny, because Haachama always cheats on Sakura Miko. They do some interesting reactions together._"

### Toto as a Good Example of Hanari’s Convincing

If she was luring her friends into the VTuber rabbit hole, does it mean that she convinced Toto to cosplay the herbivore bard Tsunomaki Watame at the event?

"_Yes, I convinced her to cosplay Watame with me, because I know Haachama and Watame are like a couple. In the very beginning when they entered Hololive, they met together and became friends, and we can see they are close. Their reactions are so fun."_

Turns out, the convincing was effective for Toto: "_I cosplayed Watame because I felt she's very, very cute, and her streams are crazy. I think I can be her, so I'm very happy (cosplaying as her)._"

## How Hanari Cosplays VTubers

Hanari has a busy cosplaying career, and we are curious how she cosplays VTubers. We went ahead and asked if she made her costumes by herself.

"_Sometimes, I would do it for myself, like some swimsuits and some underwear, some lacy stuff, I can do it by myself, like these accessories—_"

As she was cosplaying Haachama's idol outfit, she showed us the heart accessory she made.

"_Because I had to cosplay so many costumes such as Haachama and other VTubers, I don't have much time to do a lot of cosplays, so I order from shops. I seldom make costumes myself, but I know how to sew too_," she further elaborated.

We go back to the time when Hanari cosplayed as Haachama eating worms: "_Maybe the easiest part is we always can see them in their YouTube channels, and we know how they behave, know their attitude or characteristics, so that we can act like them very well and do the stuff they do, such as Haachama eating worms. I can just buy some worms and act like eating it, so I can truly cosplay as Haachama._"

According to Hanari, cosplaying as VTubers can be easy or difficult depending on their presence and popularity. "_The difficult part is, maybe, there are many VTubers, so if the VTuber you love is not that famous, you may not get her costume at shops or buy it online. You may have to make it by yourself._"

Established cosplayers such as Hanari give emphasis on costume detail and character portrayal, but on top of it all, it's the sense of enjoyment that matters. Here's her advice for others who want to start cosplaying VTubers:

"_I think they should watch more clips to know more about the VTubers they love. Actually, it's easy to cosplay VTubers because there are many costumes to choose from, and there are many products or costumes they can buy at shops or online. Just have fun on your cosplay and don't worry, be proud of yourself and act like the VTuber you like._"

## Hanari's Future VTuber Cosplay Plans

It is known that Hanari is really into Akai Haato and Sakura Miko, and when we asked about her future cosplay plans, she's keen on producing a Miko photobook: "_Actually, I've been cosplaying Miko a few times, but I'm planning to do a Miko photo book this coming December. I'll sell my merchandise in Hong Kong. I really love her and I really want to present the best cosplay of her._"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Independent VTubers Shoto and Bao are officially joining the talent roster of United Talent Agency (UTA), a global talent agency based in Beverly Hills, California.

According to a report from [_Dot Esports_](https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/sykkuno-kkatamina-more-join-uta-talent-agency-expands-streaming-vtuber), Shxtou and Bao join other popular streamers such as Sykkuno, Kkatamina, Buddha, and _Stranger Things_ actress Grace Van Dien. Unlike existing streamer organizations or agencies like 100Thieves and OfflineTV, UTA operates as a way to aid signed talents to find sponsorships and other promotional opportunities.

While Shoto hasn’t announced his signing with UTA, Bao had already posted about it on Twitter last June, stating that she is now represented by UTA.
