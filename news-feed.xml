            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Virtual YouTubers in the Philippines are gaining interest, with some of them having their own set of communities. One of the most popular local VTubers, Kaheru Orange, has a Discord audience of more than 6,000; Live2D model artist Pan the VTuber has around 5,000. This is aside from a huge number of fans following mainstream VTubers hailing from the English branches of Hololive and Nijisanji.

The increasing interest in VTubers helped fan artists create more fan merch. The recently-held [Cosplay Carnival event](https://animecorner.me/cosplay-carnival-2022-vtuber-cosplay-merchandise/) in Pasay City, miles away from the nation's capital, proved that there's a growing enthusiasm for such items.

This was further put to the test at CONQuest Festival, held at the same venue: Around [40 local VTubers](https://okayalex.com/phvtuber) collaborated with a local bullet hell game called [_Good Knight_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281400/Good_Knight/) for a huge merch drop.

![](/src/assets/content/images/conquest-2022-img20220723161221.jpg)

Over 300 types of merch such as keychains, acrylic standees, posters of various sizes, even some food and drink items, filled _Good Knight_'s booth, leaving the game's space to occupy just one side.

## How Did It Come to This?

Released September 2021 on Steam, _Good Knight_ is a one-button puzzle bullet hell game featuring bits of Philippine history and mythology. The game's uniqueness doesn't stop with the lack of buttons to use and its banger metal soundtrack—it also uses different camera angles.

One VTuber after another played the game on stream, and it led to a huge following—more than 60 VTubers shared their reactions online, compiled in one supercut:

## VTuber Standees Auctioned

![This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori](/src/assets/content/images/conquest-2022-img20220723161003.jpg "This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori_p0n's standees at the Good Knight booth inside CONQuest 2022.")

_This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori_p0n's standees at the Good Knight booth inside CONQuest 2022._

Aside from the huge merch drop, standees of some VTubers have been auctioned on Day 2. A standee of Pan was sold for Php5,500 (US$99.28 based in the current exchange rate of US$1 = Php55.40). Pinyapple Pie, who recently debuted this year, had her standee sold for Php5,000 (US$90.26). Shiori_p0n, VTuber who is also an actual surgeon, had her standee sold at Php6,000 (US$108.31)

In his [post-event reflection](https://www.facebook.com/GoodKnightGame/posts/pfbid0nnyhjvkzQcSHrvheuJRpEQfcdwVq6VY92JaJz5PMV9C48Ty6F5wqcYX7PPVAgwqBl), Alex Valdez from the _Good Knight_ team said the booth "became a home to everybody," that despite the hard decisions and sacrifices they had to take, they met one community after another. Imagine meeting the cosplay and VTuber communities altogether.

***

Concluding this piece, we congratulate Good Knight for the successful merch collab, which shows how local VTubers can band together and make history.]]></content:encoded>

The guests' lineup of activities in Canada's bilingual event includes talk panels, autograph sessions and a live concert, all in-person.

## Talk Panel

Questions from the audience are answered by the guests during the talk panel, ranging from Millie's rating of Elira's feet, favorite Pokemon, what they want to do in Montreal, worst and best cook, and poutine.

https://twitter.com/Kebby_Kebs/status/1556653008620064768

Some of the memorable answers from the guests include the following:

* Nina wanting to try the Ferris wheel
* Enna's remark to Millie: "She's the most creative streamer of all time. OF ALL TIME."
* Elira recalls her introduction to VTubers and how she became one thanks to Millie: "I sat and watched like 3 hours of VTuber videos, and I was like, 'What the hell am I being subjected to right now?' Now I am one."
* As Elira will have her 3D debut at Nijisanji Festival 2022, she mentioned there's "going to be a surprise, but there are things in the works."

## Live Concert

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The VTuber community in Indonesia is facing the effects of the country's ban on gaming platforms, with Risu Ayunda accessing Steam in offline mode.

https://twitter.com/ayunda_risu/status/1553231683121324033

The Government of Indonesia requires major platforms referred to as electronic system providers (PSE, _Penyelenggara Sistem Elektronik_) to register in their database or risk a website block. Websites that facilitate online transactions and send paid digital goods to users' devices are also affected.

[Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-signs-up-indonesias-new-licensing-rules-deadline-lapses-2022-07-21/) that regulations enacted in late November 2020 empower Indonesia's government to force platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down unlawful content. The government said these regulations were set to ensure a positive online environment.

As of press time, several websites including Reddit, Steam, PayPal, and Epic Games are blocked in the country. PayPal is used by artists as a payment gateway for commissions, and it being blocked in the country made Airani Iofifteen nervous.

https://twitter.com/airaniiofifteen/status/1553200488170287104

[Jakarta Globe reports](https://jakartaglobe.id/tech/indonesia-to-block-yahoo-amazon-for-registration-issue) that the Director General of Applied Information Technology Ministry Semuel Abrijanikata from the country's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology said close to 9,000 tech companies have registered their platforms with the government.

Most social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Tiktok, and Twitter are unaffected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nijisanji member Kai Mayuzumi formally graduates today, July 28, the same day when he debuted three years ago.

The virtual liver explained in his [announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWjHQH_5AEQ "Graduation Announcement") that he was approached by Nijisanji management about his future plans, but their plans do not align with the vision he thought-out back in August last year. Discussions ran until February this year without mutual agreement, which led to his decision to graduate.

Mayuzumi's last live stream was seen by [261,600 viewers](https://twitter.com/PTHeroPlus/status/1552677691069186048).

He hosted call-in streams on the eve of his graduation, gathering VTubers from various agencies including Nijisanji, Hololive and VSPO!.

Mayuzumi is best known for his lore and unique ways of interacting with his audience. One of Mayuyu's fans, Rei, prepared a playlist about the virtual liver's lore, together with an accompanying [master document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIVS4YxwzPhX-U5lIw2UpT4VrOFKyj4LvxdsOCH_D4I/view "The Story of Mayuzumi Kai") detailing the talent's brilliance:

Last year, he left clues for his message, which was then revealed at ALTA Studio in Shinjuku:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[### Voicing a Concern

A VTuber’s voice is everything. While a VTuber’s illustration can be idealized, their voices often can’t be, so these people can often struggle with being self-conscious of their voices. Big names in the scene like Tokoyami Towa, Selen Tatsuki, and Zentreya have all expressed serious self-doubt about their voices, but their fans support them regardless.

No one knows this story better than [Kimie](https://twitter.com/Kimie_VT)—after decades of harassment, VTubing was what gave her voice back.

> _I’m still pretty new to the scene, it’s only been a year for me,” Kimie starts. She’s a gaming streamer with well-rounded tastes. “I mainly play FPS games – pretty much Apex currently, but I also play a variety of other games, like Phasmophobia- honestly, you name it, I play it._
>
> ...Minus League of Legends. I don't touch League.

### Falling Down The Rabbit Hole

A VTuber’s journey speaks volumes – what made them want to embody anime characters on the internet? What drew Kimie to the VTubing scene?

> _So, I don’t know how long ago this was, but it was when Kizuna Ai first made the YouTube scene. I was like, what is this? This is weird. Why is there an anime girl moving and talking like a person? I thought it was really cool._

Initially, Kimie was aware of VTubers, but was hesitant to have anything to do with them.

> _It was one of those things where I knew of them, but I didn’t want to be involved. I knew of Hololive and others, and I knew of VTubers through Kizuna Ai, but I didn’t watch any of the content – I didn’t want to be a part of it, because at that time, everyone around us was getting sucked into the VTuber rabbit hole._

That reluctance gave way when Kimie understood the technology more. “I think the first part that got me into VTubing was the tech. It was as soon as I knew how accessible the tech was – easy to learn, easy to use,” she explains. The barrier of entry felt low to her, and she was interested in just messing around.

> _I would find hair, I’d find different clothes, I’d find different body types, things like that. Then, ’cause it was fascinating to me, I ordered a Leap Motion to get my hands moving – and then from there, I thought, ‘Yo, I want to try to do full body tracking.’ It was really cool. The tech behind it just fascinated me._

Though Kimie didn’t realize it at the time, she grew enamored with the idea of making an idealized version of herself. Of course, she was also enamored with the other benefits. “You know, any chance for me to be a cute anime girl on the internet, I’m gonna take it – right? That’s the dream.”

### Finding Friends and Family

It wasn’t long before Kimie found herself in the VTubing community – mostly by accident.

> _You know what’s really funny is that I never considered content creation. That wasn’t on my mind at all. I streamed for the sake of myself – there were times where I would think, ‘I wish I recorded that’. Like ‘I popped off’ or ‘that was so funny’. I didn’t think that I would actively want to make content and come up with stuff and keep people engaged and stuff like that._
>
> I was just going to be a girl with an anime avatar streaming games that I like to play with my friends.

Before being a VTuber, Kimie had streamed on Twitch before – but never with any consistency or passion. “I always wanted to do streaming. I had been streaming before, but I wouldn’t stream using my face – it would just be gameplay. Then a friend said that I didn’t have to share my face, that I could just have a model represent me.”

Somehow, that made all the difference. “I don’t know what it is, but when you see your avatar interact like you – do everything that you’re doing, speaking when you speak and stuff like that, it’s different.”

> _When I first started, I didn’t have many people that watched me – I had like maybe two or three if I was lucky. Then I started streaming more because I was really enjoying streaming with my model, and then I started getting traction which gave me a community. That’s honestly been like the main reason why I keep doing it – because I really love the community that’s been created just from me streaming. People actually enjoy me playing games, which is still really mind-blowing to me._

More than anything, it is this found family that made Kimie comfortable in the scene.

> _When I’m having really hard times, I literally open up my VTubeStudio app on my phone, and my VTuber smiles at me and it makes me feel so good. And I feel so happy because it just reminds me of like, you know, all the really nice people that I’ve met in the supportive community and how people genuinely do like you. ‘Cause if they didn’t like you, they wouldn’t be there. It’s a really nice reminder._

![](/src/assets/content/images/kimie-before-and-after-1024x576.jpg)

_Kimie’s journey as a VTuber has gone through many iterations as she’s gotten more comfortable with herself, and with VTubing._

### Hiding In Plain Sight

It was really important to Kimie that she was comfortable in the scene – because for decades, she wasn’t. “Yeah, I’m old. I’ve been playing games for a very long time, since I was like seven or eight years old. Pre-internet times, guys, dial up only became a thing when I was young. I’ve been playing online for so long, and being a girl on the internet is… it’s not that bad nowadays, but back then, in the nineties, it was a very rare thing.”

“So, I was scared to speak – I would get… stupid attention. Unwanted attention because I’m a girl and because I’m British and I sounded different,” Kimie says, echoing many women’s experiences.

“Then I had an ex-boyfriend that was from North America. A lot of the times when I would speak in my regular voice, he would make fun of me. Like he would imitate me or imitate the way I pronounce things. And that… truly shut off any British that I had left in my voice for online.”

Kimie would go on to change herself to protect herself from the harassment – without even meaning to. “All I would hang around with would be NA people, so I started subconsciously picking \[the accent\] up. I didn’t actively try to, but if that’s all you hear constantly, you start picking it up.”

### Re-finding Herself

“When I entered the VTubing community, I told people that I’m actually from the United Kingdom and they’re like, ‘well, why do you not have an accent?’ And I said I do—I do,” Kimie says. This has come up enough times that she made a TwitLonger [clearing up the misconception](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srr5so) about her voice.

![](/src/assets/content/images/chrome_6zw2uwy1x3.png)

“It’s just, um, my brain just automatically switches depending on who I hang out with. So, if you put me in front of a British person, I will start speaking normally. If you put me next to an American person, I will start speaking, you know, American, and I can switch instantly. I have no control over it, like my brain just automatically does it,” Kimie explains. Indeed, during our interview, Kimie was reflecting my American accent until this moment, when she became conscious of it.

“I’ve been trying, and it’s really difficult to break a habit that you’ve done for about 20 years now, but people started encouraging me to speak normally, saying that they won’t judge. Sometimes my British accent comes out when I pronounce certain things and my chat’s like, ‘No, no, no, it sounds really nice. Speak normally, we want you to not have to hide \[it\].’ And it’s really nice to hear that. Um, really, really nice.”

“So, it’s still a journey and it’s still a work in progress, but I’m trying to force my brain into… thinking that it’s okay to speak normally. Cause people won’t make fun of me or judge me, or you know, give me unwanted attention or harass me because of my voice,” Kimie says, with a deep sigh of relief.

_When she started, Kimie didn’t think she’d find a community.  
She didn’t think she’d stay for long._  
_She recently celebrated her one-year anniversary._

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[### Virtual entertainers, big and small

VTubers—streamers that use virtual avatars—are a phenomenon that is rapidly gaining traction worldwide. Originally starting in Japan five years ago with the rise of Kizuna Ai, VTubers are now a burgeoning industry with a strong grip on mainstays like YouTube and Twitch.

But what of the smaller VTubers? Personalities who took inspiration from industry giants like Kiryu Coco, Ironmouse, and Gawr Gura? The indie VTuber scene is complex in depth, it’s warm and welcoming, and it’s accepting newcomers every day.

There are many people that have joined the indie VTuber scene for confidence, community, and a creative outlet. Join me in talking to three such indies about the journeys they had, and the lessons they learned.

### Peering Behind the Mask

![Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pokémon.](/src/assets/content/images/mavia-pokemon.png "Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pokémon.")

_Lucastre Mavia, embroiderer harpy VTuber. Warm, comfy, and addicted to Pokémon._

I reached out to [Lucastre Mavia](https://www.youtube.com/c/maviaa), a harpy VTuber, wanting to understand the journey she’s taken as a VTuber—and she said that she’d wanted to stream and make content for quite some time.

> _I really wanted a space to create my own safe little fantasy world full of the things I love that I could share with others, just like the spaces that I found solace in. And even if it was just going to be shared with one or two people, I knew it’d still be worth it, so I just dove in without thinking too much._

This begs the question—why VTubing specifically? I asked Mavia what made her decide to take the leap with VTubing, and not any previous creative outlet. To her, personal freedom and escapism was a big deal.

> _I think escapism played a big part of what drew me to \[VTubing\], but I ended up staying for how kind the experience felt. Even if it’s just for a few hours a day, being able to immerse yourself in a world of someone’s own creation is pretty cool, I think. The rest of the world kind of fades away._

In the real world, she’s a student going through the same quarantine struggles that we all face. But as Mavia, she’s a harpy transfer student from the fantasy realm of Alknoste, and she’s here to play Pokémon and foster a warm community. Mavia’s story is echoed by thousands upon thousands of independent VTubers—people looking for freedom of expression and a strong sense of community.

### Freedom in Form and Function

There’s a subtle logic to the feeling of freedom that VTubers get when they take on their anime personalities. You would imagine them preparing to play an embellished character like an actor about to go on stage – but, no, nearly every VTuber simply plays themselves. The sneaky part is—they’re somehow more themselves.

Ask an indie VTuber why they joined the trade and they’re very likely to tell you the same thing—they wanted a character to hide behind instead of using a webcam or a disembodied voice.

Many people dream of being entertainers or even just moderately successful Twitch streamers—but are held back by fear. Thus does the subtle beauty of VTubing come to light—It’s a mask to put on, a barrier to erect that would take the brunt of the nasty reactions that we all know the internet is capable of. That air gap empowers people to be themselves without holding back.

[Akumako Rei](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKj-DqyMpHgYNB3-9lZq8-w) is another such indie, drawn to VTubing as an alternative to face cam.

> _I think removing the physical aspect makes people more confident in themselves—like if they thought they didn’t look pretty, but would be otherwise confident in their voice or personality, it would remove their worries._

Face cams have the possibility of introducing bias based on things the streamer can’t control—their physical appearance. As Rei puts it: _“…With face cam, there are privileges that are awarded just based on how people look—and VTubing evens the playing field.”_

In fact, for most of her VTubing career, Rei wasn’t even a living, breathing, anime girl. She was a static image in the corner of the screen—known as a PNGtuber—because she didn’t yet have the opportunity to get her model animated. She found that to be supremely validating, coming to the realization that, if people were still watching her, then it could only mean that _“…people like me for me, because all they’re looking at is a still image.”_

### Celebrating Their True Selves

When a nervous and socially anxious person wears their anime mask, they can put on an air of self-confidence they wouldn’t normally have in everyday life. When a camera-shy entertainer wants to show off their gaming skills, or their artistic talents, or their melodious singing, they aren’t embarrassing themselves—they’re embarrassing a persona. When someone struggling with gender or body dysphoria turns on their face-rigging technology, they can feel at ease with the body looking back at them.

To these people, VTubing isn’t just a gimmick. It’s a way to share their true selves online, on a platform uniquely suited to letting them shine. It’s what drew [Fuwako Yuni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYwIwzpWS-LyCQa8W-eJuw) into VTubing.

![](/src/assets/content/images/yuni-dbd-2.png)

_Fuwako Yuni, alicorn VTuber. Sweet and friendly, except when she’s playing Dead by Daylight._

On being asked why she became a VTuber, Yuni prioritized _“…the freedom and creative form of expression that you can’t get with in-real-life content creation. While it has its own limitations in comparison, as a VTuber you create who you want to be.”_

> _I definitely feel like I’m more myself when I’m using my model… There are so many things that you can’t or just don’t have the means to control, that you can change with your model. Body type, hair style, color, height, gender, you don’t even need to be human if you don’t want to. I think it’s a lot of fun to see how people choose to express themselves with the amount of freedom that comes with their model._

Overwhelmingly, VTubers see the technology as a boost to confidence. If anyone can look like anything, then your looks don’t actually matter. But don’t take my word for it—Mavia explains it well:

> _I think that with only your words and actions to judge you by, and a lack of obligation to people who make you uncomfortable, it’s a lot easier to create a curated personal experience and community online. And when you find like-minded or open-minded people, you feel more comfortable speaking your mind._

### The VTuber Family

Community is tantamount to the indie scene, something that is readily apparent to viewers—VTubers all seem to know each other. Collaborations are a frequent sight, and everyone is friendly enough that a small VTuber will often be able to stream alongside someone they idolized just weeks ago. Mavia’s advice? Make friends.

> _I think when you’re a smaller streamer, there’s this fear that you shouldn’t reach out to larger ones because they might think you’re just looking for an easy plug. My experiences with creators, however small or large, have been extremely positive. I really encourage new VTubers to not be shy and reach out to make new friends._

It’s no surprise—in a community where everyone has similar interests in anime and gaming, it’s not hard to find friends. Beyond that, everyone is incredibly helpful.

VTubing is new—the concept is only a few years old, and the technology is evolving every day. To a fresh-faced VTuber, that means everyone they look up to was in their shoes very recently.

Everyone understands the growing pains, the small-streamer struggles of finding friends, troubleshooting technical issues, and growing a fanbase. As such, a new VTuber will find no shortage of people that aren’t merely understanding but will go out of their way to help.

### The Gate’s Open

To any prospective VTubers, Mavia suggests taking it slow, and enjoying the process and the community.

> _Stream to your friends. Just because you enjoy watching someone stream something or you enjoy doing something doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy streaming it. Figure out one or two things you want to focus on and focus your energy into doing those things and doing them well._

> _Take it slow. Don’t expect instant growth, especially if you’re not coming from a content creation background. Connect with people and form friendships and good relationships. Of course, it’s still important to be critical of yourself. What kinds of content creators do you enjoy watching, and why? How can you put your own spin on that? Give it a try. If you don’t like it, try something else. There’s no rush._

She also suggests making use of resource marketplaces. _“Booth, Nizima, Twitter and DLsite are your best friends for finding assets and models. There are tons of free assets, too! Make sure to credit your artists.”_

Rei suggests that you pander only to your biggest fan—yourself.

> _Honestly, my advice is—you do you. Don’t feel pressured to do things to make you big. Yeah, you can go get a hot model and sound cute, but the people that like that content won’t stay for long. Be true to yourself, as true as you want to be. You can still play a character, but if you don’t like certain kinds of content, don’t make it._

Rei also suggests you prepare for a long journey. _“Stars aren’t born, they’re made like swords. Hit them over and over again until they’re sharp enough to strike.”_

Yuni stresses the importance of taking things slowly but surely, honing your experience and skill along the way

> _My best advice for people is to start streaming—having a fancy model means nothing if you do nothing with it. Getting experience and learning to overcome the hurdles of being a new streamer will help you much more than waiting until you have the best model you can. If you plan on investing into streaming, try to do it smartly with things that remain useful even if you don’t keep streaming, such as microphones or monitors._

### You’re Invited

The VTuber world is expansive, it’s freeing, and it’s welcoming. However, it’s certainly no utopia—it’s an industry that expects heavy monetary investment in your computer, your streaming equipment, and your VTuber model itself. However, if you just want to dip your toes into the community and get a feel for how you’d like it—if you’ve ever thought you wanted to stream or create but held yourself back—then there are free ways to see if VTubing is right for you.

First and foremost, any aspiring VTuber should find solace and friendship with other aspiring VTubers, in the [ENVTubers Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/envtubers). This community has been cultivated to be the perfect launchpad for new VTubers, giving them the answers, resources, and camaraderie they need.

You’ll also need a VTuber model itself, to which I recommend [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) to create a 3D model, and [VSeeFace]() to capture your face. Both services are free, and [Argama Witch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwpITXXDve9uqRDwKp7yXKhQCqCAsnH3j) has great tutorials on making the most use of VRoid Studio to help you create the model that perfectly represents you.

VTubing is a big industry and it’s getting bigger. Many of the big names have never streamed before being a VTuber. The gate is wide open, whether you want to express yourself, shoot for fame and fortune, or simply want to be the anime person of your dreams.
