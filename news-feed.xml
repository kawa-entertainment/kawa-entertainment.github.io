            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Independent VTubers Shoto and Bao are officially joining the talent roster of United Talent Agency (UTA), a global talent agency based in Beverly Hills, California.

According to a report from [_Dot Esports_](https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/sykkuno-kkatamina-more-join-uta-talent-agency-expands-streaming-vtuber), Shxtou and Bao join other popular streamers such as Sykkuno, Kkatamina, Buddha, and _Stranger Things_ actress Grace Van Dien. Unlike existing streamer organizations or agencies like 100Thieves and OfflineTV, UTA operates as a way to aid signed talents to find sponsorships and other promotional opportunities.

While Shoto hasn’t announced his signing with UTA, Bao had already posted about it on Twitter last June, stating that she is now represented by UTA.

Shoto debuted on October 2, 2021, and is part of an independent VTuber group called Hanamori. Meanwhile, Bao, who previously produced music under the name Hikaru Station, debuted on October 30, 2020, where she released her single “52-Hearts.”]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Naki Kamizuki, a VTuber from PRISM Project, has announced that her YouTube channel was terminated for no reason after all. The channel termination follows after Naki did a watch-along for the first three episodes of the anime series _Fuuto Pi_, albeit she has reasoned that she hasn’t shown anything on screen when her channel was terminated.

https://twitter.com/nakikamizuki/status/1560877509884817408

Following the incident, PRISM Project has stated that they are investigating YouTube’s actions regarding the channel termination, and rest assured that they will provide more information in the following days.

https://twitter.com/PRISMproj/status/1560882807097806848

Putting humor regarding the situation, Naki joked that the reason for her channel to get terminated was due to her [showing her thighs](https://twitter.com/nakikamizuki/status/1560879365545545729) on stream.

The channel is now restored after almost seven hours, but she has postponed her book club stream until they hear feedback from YouTube regarding this matter.

https://twitter.com/nakikamizuki/status/1560987689020624896

Naki Kamizuki is part of PRISM Project’s fourth generation, alongside Sara Nagare, Sumi Ushio and Non Anon. She debuted on November 13, 2021, and has recently celebrated her birthday on August 13.

PRISM Project has also stated that orders for [Naki’s birthday merchandise](https://prismproject.booth.pm/items/4076467) and voice pack will be only available up until next week. ]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Axia Krone from Nijisanji's Eden-gumi group is going on an indefinite hiatus following reports of constant slander and targeted online harassment against him on-stream.

In a [statement](https://www.anycolor.co.jp/news/ptphttmlev) posted by parent company ANYCOLOR, the hiatus was made following Axia’s wishes to take a break, as the negative comments have affected not only the talent’s physical and mental health, but also other talents around him.

ANYCOLOR has stressed in their statement that the online harassment has greatly affected their livestream distribution, and that they would not tolerate such fan behavior to carry on across their online channels.

The company also added that following these negative events, they are filing criminal charges against online users who have spread such malicious information regarding Krone and other talents.

“We have already started concrete legal measures to deal with the malicious business obstruction and infringement of goodwill against our business in cooperation with our legal advisory firm and the police,” ANYCOLOR stated.

In addition, the company has already identified certain websites that are promoting such negative statements targeted towards their talents. It has also encouraged the public to report to them if they see any forms of targeted harassment against their talents moving forward.

Krone released two videos before proceeding with his indefinite hiatus, the first is [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGvMKhAHEGw) addressing possessive fans, and the second is a diss track.

`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkOciDA_WRA`

The press release also noted that the Tony the Tiger VTuber will be streaming on Twitch on August 19 (5:00-7:00PM PST) alongside streamers Brennon “GoldGlove” O'Neill, Chrissy Costanza, and Jakeem “BigCheese” Johnson.

“Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and Tony the Tiger are always looking for ways to connect with lifelong fans and the next generation of cereal lovers, whether that's through releasing new fun flavors of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes or by showing up in new places," said Sadie Garcia, Director of Brand Marketing at Kellogg All Family Cereal.

The campaign is called _Tony the Tiger's GR-R-REAT CEREAL BOWL OF GR-R-REATNESS_, and is done exclusively in partnership with Twitch.

Adam Harris, Global Head of Twitch's Brand Partnership Studio, commented, “This innovative concept taps into the growing popularity of VTubing on Twitch, where we saw VTubing content increase 467% YoY last year. Together with Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, we're producing a made-for-the-Twitch community live experience that introduces a beloved character to well-known Twitch streamers, fosters a healthy dose of competition, and encourages viewers to interact with Tony the Tiger in real-time in chat.”

Tony the Tiger’s VTuber is the latest slew of brands who have turned their recognizable mascots into VTubers, including Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, and Knuckles; as well as Crunchyroll-Hime.

https://twitter.com/CosplayManiaPH/status/1558332698304856065

Risu from HoloID first generation is known best for her content, including the 30-day [Non-Stop Nut November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0h_8ewFizI&list=PLHeIKIUgnbJBH0BVTdiAiOs-fIyV6Yx8n) clips and [classic stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Y-XuaSwqU) where she counts the coins inside HoloID genmate Moona Hoshinova's coin bank without permission.

Aside from this, she has released songs such as [ALiCE&u](https://youtu.be/IGviVpVE1fA), [Harapan PanPanPan](https://youtu.be/N9M5jX9z5cQ) with Holostars' Aragami Oga, and [HI-15](https://youtu.be/XSZNNbbVuho) with Moona and Airani Iofifteen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Virtual YouTubers in the Philippines are gaining interest, with some of them having their own set of communities. One of the most popular local VTubers, Kaheru Orange, has a Discord audience of more than 6,000; Live2D model artist Pan the VTuber has around 5,000. This is aside from a huge number of fans following mainstream VTubers hailing from the English branches of Hololive and Nijisanji.

The increasing interest in VTubers helped fan artists create more fan merch. The recently-held [Cosplay Carnival event](https://animecorner.me/cosplay-carnival-2022-vtuber-cosplay-merchandise/) in Pasay City, miles away from the nation's capital, proved that there's a growing enthusiasm for such items.

This was further put to the test at CONQuest Festival, held at the same venue: Around [40 local VTubers](https://okayalex.com/phvtuber) collaborated with a local bullet hell game called [_Good Knight_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281400/Good_Knight/) for a huge merch drop.

![](/src/assets/content/images/conquest-2022-img20220723161221.jpg)

Over 300 types of merch such as keychains, acrylic standees, posters of various sizes, even some food and drink items, filled _Good Knight_'s booth, leaving the game's space to occupy just one side.

## How Did It Come to This?

Released September 2021 on Steam, _Good Knight_ is a one-button puzzle bullet hell game featuring bits of Philippine history and mythology. The game's uniqueness doesn't stop with the lack of buttons to use and its banger metal soundtrack—it also uses different camera angles.

One VTuber after another played the game on stream, and it led to a huge following—more than 60 VTubers shared their reactions online, compiled in one supercut:

## VTuber Standees Auctioned

![This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori](/src/assets/content/images/conquest-2022-img20220723161003.jpg "This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori_p0n's standees at the Good Knight booth inside CONQuest 2022.")

_This author takes a photo of Pan and Shiori_p0n's standees at the Good Knight booth inside CONQuest 2022._

Aside from the huge merch drop, standees of some VTubers have been auctioned on Day 2. A standee of Pan was sold for Php5,500 (US$99.28 based in the current exchange rate of US$1 = Php55.40). Pinyapple Pie, who recently debuted this year, had her standee sold for Php5,000 (US$90.26). Shiori_p0n, VTuber who is also an actual surgeon, had her standee sold at Php6,000 (US$108.31)

`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI3kDC5llfc`

In his [post-event reflection](https://www.facebook.com/GoodKnightGame/posts/pfbid0nnyhjvkzQcSHrvheuJRpEQfcdwVq6VY92JaJz5PMV9C48Ty6F5wqcYX7PPVAgwqBl), Alex Valdez from the _Good Knight_ team said the booth "became a home to everybody," that despite the hard decisions and sacrifices they had to take, they met one community after another. Imagine meeting the cosplay and VTuber communities altogether.

Concluding this piece, we congratulate Good Knight for the successful merch collab, which shows how local VTubers can band together and make history.]]></content:encoded>
