What happens to my old identity/model?","answer":"You will continue with your old identity/model. We plan to \"adopt\" our talents. Our lower royalty shares force us to focus on what's essential, and for us, that's evolving our talent's current brand. If it isn't broken, don't fix it. However, if the talent requires a new model, we plan to work out a custom deal with them on a case-by-case basis."}},{"node":{"id":"1","question":"Since you're adopting the model, what does that mean for Intellectual Property/copyright?","answer":"The Intellectual Property (copyright) for the talent's model stays entirely with them even upon signing with us. You license us your image/model to make merch, advertise, etc. However, your model is still yours at the end of the day, even if we part ways."}},{"node":{"id":"2","question":"Are there any gender limits for those applying?","answer":"No. Any gender can apply."}},{"node":{"id":"3","question":"Are there any age limits for those applying?","answer":"Yes.

If selected, you will have to transfer to Youtube for future streams."}},{"node":{"id":"8","question":"Will all talents have to move to youtube?","answer":"Yes.

We chose Youtube due to our vast experience with it."}},{"node":{"id":"9","question":"How many talents will you pick for generation 1?","answer":"We plan to sign around 3-4 talents for generation 1."}},{"node":{"id":"10","question":"Do I have to have a certain number of followers, subscribers, or viewers?","answer":"No. However, we are looking for established content creators, so the longer you've been streaming, the better."}},{"node":{"id":"11","question":"Will you help with stream hardware?","answer":"Yes.

Our goal is to help be a buffer for our talents and reduce the amount of business-orientated stuff they do."}},{"node":{"id":"14","question":"Will you help with sponsorships?","answer":"Yes. We plan to get our talents sponsors on their request."}},{"node":{"id":"15","question":"Will you help with merchandise?","answer":"Yes. We will create essential merchandise for each talent.

However, we will not be buying the talent hardware upfront on joining signing with Kawa."}},{"node":{"id":"18","question":"Who are you?","answer":"We are a team of past/previous vtubers, vtuber enjoyers, and small business owners.
