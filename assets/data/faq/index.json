We 'adopt' VTubers that are already streaming and seek to nurture their branding through various perks that would be hard for an individual to procure, while also connecting them with fellow content creators."}},{"node":{"id":"1","question":"What do you mean by ‘Adoption Agency’?","answer":"Most VTuber agencies provide new identities and models to their talents, which has two unfortunate side effects - The talent would have to retire their old character, and the agency would own the IP of the new character. Instead of forcing our talents to give up their personalized identities, we have hired them as-is. The talents retain all ownership of their IP."}},{"node":{"id":"2","question":"What are Kawa’s goals?","answer":"We're here to support our talents as much as possible, while not getting in the way. They know their content best, and we aren't here to change that."}},{"node":{"id":"3","question":"Who are you?","answer":"We are a team of VTubers, VTuber fans, and established business owners. If you'd like to read more, consider checking out our \"About us\" page!"}},{"node":{"id":"4","question":"Where are you located?","answer":"We are located in Austin, Texas. Happy to meet y'all!"}},{"node":{"id":"5","question":"What exactly do you offer your talents?","answer":"We want to make our talents stand out with quality merchandising and cutting-edge streaming tools. Besides that, we offer support, management, and networking."}},{"node":{"id":"6","question":"How much control do you exert over your talents?","answer":"Each talent determines exactly how much management they want. Some want in-depth management over schedules and stream improvements, some want us to be almost entirely hands-off except for large events like sponsorships or song covers. We will never make a talent do or say anything they don't want to."}},{"node":{"id":"7","question":"Where’s the name come from?","answer":"A love of bad puns. 'Kawa' is the Japanese word for 'river', and rivers are greater than streams. It gets worse. We called ourselves Kawa Entertainment because the shortened 'Kawa E' sounds like 'kawaii'."}},{"node":{"id":"8","question":"Where can I see your merchandise offerings?","answer":"Our in-stock and preorder only products are available under Merch, or at merch.kawaentertainment.com."}},{"node":{"id":"9","question":"Are talents paid when merchandise is sold?","answer":"Yes, a percentage of each sale goes directly to the talent. The rates differ from product to product."}},{"node":{"id":"10","question":"Can I draw fanart of Kawa talents?","answer":"Yes! Each of our talents has a fanart tag, please use them if you plan on posting on Twitter, we'd love to see it!"}},{"node":{"id":"11","question":"Can I clip Kawa talents?","answer":"Yes, but please credit their respective channels in the description or title upon re-posting. You may monetize the clip as long as it is sufficiently edited - i.e., you are monetizing your addition to the stream. You may not simply monetize an unedited section of a talent’s stream."}},{"node":{"id":"12","question":"Can I use Kawa’s logo or any of your talent’s logos?","answer":"We do not want there to be misunderstandings in what is official or fan made, please do not use our official logo on any fan projects or merchandise. Each talent’s logos may have similar restrictions."}}]}},"context":{}}
